# NLP-Powered Online Shopping Platform

---

## Project Overview

Flask-based e-commerce web application integrating machine learning-driven review recommendations and intelligent product search. This project enables users to browse clothing items, submit product reviews, and receive automated purchase suggestions through a trained ML classification model leveraging NLP techniques. It features real-time search functionality with flexible keyword matching, semantic relevance scoring, and result ranking. The backend supports dynamic content rendering, RESTful API routing, and structured data management using CSV/JSON, while the frontend offers a responsive, mobile-friendly user interface. Built with scalability in mind, the system showcases end-to-end integration of web development, NLP, and AI inference, significantly enhancing user engagement and reducing manual review moderation.
